      <q>Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses. Every single time.</q> &mdash; Linus Torvalds
      
      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>This is a website dedicated towards understanding a website from
	scratch with the inclusion of using a graphics library called <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene" target_="blank">three.js</a>.
	This website hosts demos of 3D renderings that I find cool. </p>

      <h2>What can I do here?</h2>
      <p>Well frankly, I just created this website for my own purposes.
	You can copy and paste code here onto your projects, or even
	throw insults at my coding style (that's the point of learning!).</p>
